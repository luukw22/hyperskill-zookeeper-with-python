# Hyperskill Python Core: Zookeeper with Python project
Help the local zoo take care of its animals by building a tool to keep an eye on them. Create your first program that works with your data.

## About
Learn the very basics of Python coding by building a simple tool for zookeepers. Get to know how to work with variables and lists, put them in while loops and develop a simple console app from scratch.

## Training project
This project allows you to practice and strengthen your coding skills, helping you get ready for more advanced tasks ahead.

### Stage 2/4: Show me an animal!
Show the zookeeper an image of her ward.
- Quotes and multi-line strings
- Basic data types
- PEP 8: Coding style guide
- Comments

### Stage 3/4: What's inside?
The zookeeper wants to know what is inside each habitat, by its number.
- List
- Variables
- Taking user's input
- Indexes
